// To sort any Collections --> (ex: ArrayList,..)
//Suppose ArrayList a;
Collections.sort(a);


// If you neeed powers of 2 --> ALWAYS USE Binary Manipulation Instead of Math.pow
// Binary Manipulation is very FAST compared to Math.pow
// NOTE: For POWERS OF TWO ONLY
// 2^n = 1<<n; 
// But be CAREFUL that n>=0, If nbecomes negative --> will give weird results
